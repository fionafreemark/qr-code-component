## My process
I have been working in React with Sass a lot recently, and though its logical to use those to build a component, I haven't build something in simple HTML/CSS for some time. I thought I'd use this starter project as a quick refresher and aim to build it with React/Sass at a later time. 
My process was to map out how each of the HTML elements would be nested together so I could easily style them later on. Then I used the Figma file to outline the specific typography styles and filled in the rest of the positioning afterward.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
